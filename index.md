## About me:

I am a geoscientist working on seismicity, fault zone physics, and slow earthquakes. A set of detection and location codes can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/YijianZhou). My recent research activities are posted on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yijian-Zhou-3)

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in UC, Riverside, under the supervision of [Abhijit Ghosh](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~aghosh/)
