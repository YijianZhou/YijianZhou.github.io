## About me:

I am a geoscientist working on seismicity, fault zone physics, and slow earthquakes. A set of detection and location codes can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/YijianZhou). My recent research activities are posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yijian_zhou), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yijian-Zhou-3), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JgxHkKgAAAAJ&hl=en)

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in UC Riverside, working with [Abhijit Ghosh](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~aghosh/)

## News and Events  

**[2024.05] I Got the SSA student presentation award!**  
Did't even remember I participate, but it's so lucky to get it: I'll no longer be a Ph.D. student :)

**[2024.04] Finished [manuscript on LoSAR](http://dx.doi.org/10.22541/essoar.171412572.25170940/v1), finally ...**  
I think the earthquake cataloging problem is solved to a satisfactory degree, and I can mentally move on to sooooo many other interesting projects!

**[2023.12] AGU at SF**  
Good to see AGU getting beck to its pre-COVID state, and I'm able to meet my Chinese friends

**[2023.07] Summer Intern at LLNL**  
Our lab do not support students during summer, but LLNL pays well!  

**[2023.06] Back to China for a short visit!**  
My classmates have begun their search for positions in academia, a challenging endeavor, yet their unwavering passion for research remains undiminished.  

**[2023.05] The [EQS paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370402790_High-Resolution_Seismicity_Imaging_for_the_2023_Kahramanmaras_SE_Turkiye_Mw_79_78_Earthquake_Doublet_with_Early_Aftershocks) on 2023 Turkey aftershock catalog is accepted**  
This is my first rapid response to an event of international attention. Several encouraging details to name:  
(1) [The twitter I posted](https://twitter.com/yijian_zhou/status/1636837939006283777) got wide recognition  
(2) Prof. Anthony Lomax also extends appreciations to my results!  
(3) I have one more reliable collaborator, Hongyang Ding, a 1st-year PhD from PKU  

**[2023.05] I received the Roland Blanchard Award in our department!**  
The 24W quarter will be my first quarter without being TA :)  

**[2023.03] The [SRL paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367519243_2022_Mw_66_Luding_China_Earthquake_A_Strong_Continental_Event_Illuminating_the_Moxi_Seismic_Gap) on 2022 Luding earthquake is accepted** after being rejected by Science China last year :)  
This is my first second- & corresponding-author paper, meaning that it is completed with my hands-on supervision  

**[2023.03] The [GJI paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369532552_Detection_of_Fault_Zone_Head_Waves_and_the_Fault_Interface_Imaging_in_the_Xianshuihe-Anninghe_Fault_Zone_Eastern_Tibetan_Plateau) on fault zone head waves in Anninghe-Zemuhe fault zone is accepted**  
After this training, our first author, Longtan Wang, is now a beast!
