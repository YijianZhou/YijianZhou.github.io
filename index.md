## About me:

I am a geoscientist working on seismicity, fault zone physics, and slow earthquakes. A set of detection and location codes can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/YijianZhou). My recent research activities are posted on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yijian-Zhou-3) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JgxHkKgAAAAJ&hl=en)

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in UC Riverside, working with [Abhijit Ghosh](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~aghosh/)
